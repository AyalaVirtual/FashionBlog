    <p><a href="https://www.vogue.com/fashion" target="_blank">Fashion</a> can be both a creative way of expressing yourself & incredibly intimidating, especially if you don't consider yourself much of a fashionista. Luckily, I’m here to give you an insider’s guide on how to create your own style without sacrificing your comfort. Follow these tips and you'll be setting trends in no time!
    </p>
    <h2>Developing Your Own Style</h2>

    <p>
      Be the trend-setter, not the trend-follower. Icons don't follow what everyone else is doing. They blaze their own trail and take the road less traveled. Dare to be different!
    </p>
    <h2>You Can Still Be Stylin' Without the Stilettos</h2>

    <p>
      Remember that your style is your own. Don't feel pressured to wear something that's tight or uncomfortable just because it looks good. Just because it's all the rage in Europe right now doesn't mean you have to break your neck trying to walk in 6 inch heels. Stay within your comfort limits and own it. Remember, you wear the clothes, the clothes don't wear you.
